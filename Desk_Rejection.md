Title: The Misclassification Likelihood Matrix:  Some Classes Are More Likely To Be Misclassified Than Others
Submitted to: Computers & Graphics

Dear Mr Daniel Sikar,

Thank you for your interest in, and submission of a manuscript to Computers and Graphics. I have read your submission above with interest. While I personally find the work interesting and addressing a challenging subject, I am sorry to inform you that the manuscript cannot be considered for publication in Computers and Graphics.
You see, Computers & Graphics is dedicated to disseminating information on research and applications of computer graphics (CG) techniques. The journal encourages articles on
1. Research and applications of interactive computer graphics. We are particularly interested in novel interaction techniques and applications of CG to problem domains.
2. State-of-the-art papers on late-breaking, cutting-edge research on CG.
3. Information on innovative uses of graphics principles and technologies.
4. Tutorial papers on both teaching CG principles and innovative uses of CG in education.

Computers & Graphics provides a medium to communicate information concerning interactive CG and CG applications. The journal focuses on interactive computer graphics, visualization, and novel input modalities including virtual environments, and, within this scope, on graphical models, data structures, languages, picture manipulation algorithms, and related software.

As you can see from the above there is little match between your submitted manuscript's subject matter and the Journal aims and Editorial Scope.

Please bear in mind that this decision in no way reflects the technical merits or intrinsic qualities of your work. Rather, it is grounded solely on matters of scope and adequacy. Find more detailed feedback below.

Let me wish you every success in getting your paper published at a more appropriate venue.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.

Yours sincerely,

Joaquim Jorge, PhD

Comments to Authors:


Outside of Scope

While your results are potentially interesting, your manuscript's topic falls outside this journal's scope. For a detailed overview of the journal’s Aims & Scope, please refer to our homepage at https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-graphics . We hope you will consider this journal for future studies that align more closely with its focus. For your current submission, we recommend exploring other venues that may be more suited to your research topic. See more details below.


After a preliminary and careful review, the submitted manuscript titled "The Misclassification Likelihood Matrix: Some Classes Are More Likely to Be Misclassified Than Others" is outside the primary scope of Computers & Graphics. The manuscript primarily explores machine learning reliability, neural network prediction behaviors under distribution shifts, and risk mitigation strategies for automated decision-making, which are not central to the journal's focus on advancing research in computer graphics, visualization, virtual reality, and related computational technologies.

Desk Rejection Decision
Given its emphasis on machine learning methodologies and their applications rather than innovations in computer graphics or visualization techniques, this manuscript is not suitable for publication in Computers & Graphics. Below, I offer recommendations for alternate venues:

Suggested Journals and Conferences


Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)
Focus: Fundamental and applied machine learning research, including interpretability and neural network reliability.
URL: https://www.jmlr.org
Relevance: This journal emphasizes theoretical and methodological advancements in machine learning, aligning with the development and evaluation of the Misclassification Likelihood Matrix (MLM).


IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)
Focus: Neural networks and learning systems, emphasizing theory, design, and applications.
URL: https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-neural-networks-and-learning-systems
Relevance: Well-suited for manuscripts that delve into clustering techniques, misclassification analysis, and model reliability under distribution shifts.


Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
Focus: Interdisciplinary research on machine learning, AI, and neural information processing.
URL: https://nips.cc
Relevance: A top-tier conference for presenting advancements like MLM that address machine learning challenges in high-stakes domains.


Pattern Recognition (Elsevier)
Focus: Techniques for pattern recognition, including classification and clustering methods.
URL: https://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition
Relevance: Offers a platform for work highlighting advancements in classification reliability and decision-making frameworks.


Feedback Summary
Strengths: The manuscript introduces an innovative method for quantifying misclassification likelihood and offers detailed evaluations of distance measures, which may be impactful in the fields of machine learning and autonomous systems.
Suggestions: To better fit the suggested venues, emphasize connections to real-world applications, domain-specific challenges, and broader implications for machine learning reliability.
