Write a prompt that would have generated the following reply. Put tags in the placeholders e.g. <ARTICLE_TITLE>, <OTHER_PUBLICATIONS> and list any additional required context data to generate to be supplied together with the prompt. If you have any questions, ask.

## Deep Seek Chain of Thought

Okay, so I need to figure out what prompt would generate the given rejection email from the journal. Let me start by analyzing the email's content.

The email is a desk rejection from the Editor-in-Chief of Computers & Graphics. The main reason is that the manuscript's topic doesn't align with the journal's scope, which focuses on computer graphics, visualization, VR, etc. The submitted paper is about machine learning reliability, specifically the Misclassification Likelihood Matrix, which deals with neural network misclassifications. The editor suggests alternative journals like JMLR, IEEE TNNLS, NeurIPS, and Pattern Recognition.

So, the user probably submitted a manuscript to this journal and got rejected. The task is to reverse-engineer the original submission prompt that led to this rejection. The prompt needs placeholders like <ARTICLE_TITLE> and <OTHER_PUBLICATIONS>, and list any additional context required.

First, identify the key elements in the rejection email. The title of the article is given, as well as the suggested journals. The email also mentions the journal's scope, so the prompt might need to reference the aims and scope of Computers & Graphics. The user might have asked for a rejection letter based on scope mismatch, including feedback and alternative venues.

The prompt would need to include the article title, the target journal, and possibly the other suggested publications. Additional context might include the journal's scope details, the article's abstract or key topics, and the focus areas of the suggested alternative journals.

Wait, the prompt should be what the user would input to generate such a rejection. So maybe the user is an editor or a system generating rejection emails. The prompt would instruct to write a rejection email for a submission that's out of scope, including specific elements like title, journal name, reasons related to scope, and alternative journals.

The placeholders in the prompt would be for the article title, the target journal, and other publications. The required context data would include the journal's aims and scope, the manuscript's main topics, and the list of alternative journals with their URLs and relevance.

But the email also includes specific feedback about the manuscript's strengths and suggestions, so the prompt might need to include that as well. The user might have provided the article's focus on machine learning reliability, neural networks under distribution shifts, etc., and the alternative journals' details.

So putting it all together, the prompt would ask to generate a rejection email for a manuscript submitted to a specific journal, detailing scope mismatch, providing alternative venues, and including feedback on strengths and suggestions. The placeholders would replace specific details like the article title, journal name, and other publications. Additional context needed would be the journal's scope description, the manuscript's abstract/key points, and the alternative journals' information.

I need to make sure all elements from the email are covered: the desk rejection, scope explanation, suggested journals with URLs and relevance, feedback summary (strengths and suggestions), and the caution note about the email's origin. The prompt should include all these elements with placeholders where specific data is inserted.

Also, the email includes standard sections like the reference number, sender info, and the Elsevier safety guidelines. The prompt might need to include those as part of the structure, using placeholders where necessary.

Therefore, the final prompt would involve generating a desk rejection email from the Editor-in-Chief of a journal, using the provided article details, journal scope, and alternative publication suggestions. The required context data would be the article's title, target journal name and scope, manuscript's key topics, and the list of alternative journals with their details.

## Prompt

Write a formal desk rejection email from the Editor-in-Chief of <JOURNAL_NAME> to the author of the manuscript titled "<ARTICLE_TITLE>". The email must:  
1. State that the submission cannot proceed due to scope mismatch, referencing the journal’s focus on <JOURNAL_SCOPE_KEYWORDS> (e.g., interactive computer graphics, visualization, virtual reality).  
2. Provide a brief summary of the journal’s scope from its aims (use 3-4 bullet points).  
3. Acknowledge the technical merit of the work but clarify the scope misalignment, specifically noting the manuscript’s focus on <MANUSCRIPT_TOPICS> (e.g., machine learning reliability, neural network misclassification analysis).  
4. Include a "Suggested Journals and Conferences" section with 3-4 alternative venues (names, URLs, relevance explanations).  
5. Add a "Feedback Summary" with 1-2 strengths (e.g., innovative methodology, evaluation rigor) and 1-2 suggestions (e.g., emphasizing domain applications).  
6. Incorporate standard elements: reference number, editor’s signature, safety/guidance links from the publisher, and a caution about external email origins.  
Use a professional tone, avoid overly technical jargon, and structure the email as shown in the example.

Required Context Data:

    Placeholders to Replace:

        <ARTICLE_TITLE>: Title of the rejected manuscript (e.g., "The Misclassification Likelihood Matrix...").

        <JOURNAL_NAME>: Target journal name (e.g., "Computers & Graphics").

        <JOURNAL_SCOPE_KEYWORDS>: Keywords from the journal’s scope (e.g., "interactive computer graphics, visualization, novel input modalities").

        <MANUSCRIPT_TOPICS>: Key topics of the manuscript (e.g., "machine learning reliability, neural network prediction behaviors under distribution shifts").

        <OTHER_PUBLICATIONS>: List of alternative venues with names, URLs, and relevance blurbs (e.g., Journal of Machine Learning Research, IEEE TNNLS).

    Additional Data to Supply:

        Journal’s official aims and scope (bullet points).

        Manuscript’s abstract or key contributions.

        Predefined safety/guidance links (e.g., Elsevier’s APC scam guidelines).

        Editor’s name, position, and contact information.

Clarifying Example:
If the user needs to adjust the feedback’s specificity (e.g., tailoring strengths/suggestions to the manuscript’s technical focus), ask:

Should the "Feedback Summary" include domain-specific examples (e.g., autonomous systems, healthcare AI) or remain general?
