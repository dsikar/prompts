To estimate how long the job **101M_PS8** will run, we can analyze the provided data and make some assumptions based on the current progress and the total number of epochs.

### Key Information:
1. **Current Epoch (Ep):** 1828/5000  
   - The job has completed 1828 epochs out of a total of 5000 epochs.
2. **Job Start Time:** 21:22:48  
   - The job started at 21:22:48 (9:22 PM).
3. **Current Time:** 21:35:14  
   - The current time is 21:35:14 (9:35 PM), meaning the job has been running for approximately **12 minutes** so far.

### Calculations:
1. **Epochs Completed:** 1828  
2. **Time Taken for 1828 Epochs:** ~12 minutes  
   - This means the job is completing approximately **1828 epochs / 12 minutes = ~152.3 epochs per minute**.

3. **Total Epochs Remaining:** 5000 - 1828 = 3172 epochs  
4. **Estimated Time Remaining:**  
   - If the job continues at the same rate of ~152.3 epochs per minute, the remaining 3172 epochs will take approximately:  
     **3172 epochs / 152.3 epochs per minute = ~20.8 minutes**.

5. **Total Estimated Runtime:**  
   - Time already elapsed: 12 minutes  
   - Estimated time remaining: ~20.8 minutes  
   - **Total runtime: ~32.8 minutes**.

### Conclusion:
The job **101M_PS8** is expected to run for approximately **33 minutes** in total, meaning it should finish around **21:55 PM** (9:55 PM). This estimate assumes that the rate of epoch completion remains consistent throughout the job.

Here's an estimation of the remaining runtime for job 101M_PS8 (job ID 950888), based on the provided data:

**1. Current Progress:**

*   The output shows the training is at epoch 1828 out of 5000. This means it has completed approximately 1828/5000 = 36.56% of the epochs.

**2. Time Elapsed:**

*   `squeue` output shows the job has been running for 21 hours, 22 minutes, and 48 seconds. Let's approximate this to 21.4 hours.

**3. Time per Epoch (Average):**

*   If 36.56% of the training took 21.4 hours, then one epoch takes approximately 21.4 hours / 0.3656 = 58.5 hours/epoch.

**4. Remaining Epochs:**

*   There are 5000 - 1828 = 3172 epochs remaining.

**5. Estimated Remaining Time:**

*   The estimated remaining time is 3172 epochs * 58.5 hours/epoch ≈ 185,562 hours.

**6. Converting to More Understandable Units:**

*   185,562 hours / 24 hours/day ≈ 7732 days
*   7732 days / 365 days/year ≈ 21 years

**Conclusion:**

Based on this rough calculation, the job *appears* to have an extremely long remaining runtime. This is clearly unreasonable and indicates there's a significant problem with the calculation. The issue is that the time per epoch is not constant. In neural network training, the time per epoch often *decreases* as the model learns and the changes in weights become smaller. Therefore, simply extrapolating from the initial epochs is highly inaccurate.

**A More Realistic Approach (and why we can't do it here):**

A more accurate way to estimate remaining time would involve:

*   **Looking at the loss curve:** If the loss is still decreasing significantly, more training is needed. If the loss has plateaued, the job might be close to convergence. *We don't have enough loss information to do this.*
*   **Observing changes in training time per epoch over time:** If the time per epoch is decreasing, we can use a more sophisticated extrapolation method. *We only have data from a very small portion of the training, so we can't observe this trend.*
*   **Using early stopping criteria:** If the validation performance stops improving for a certain number of epochs, the training can be stopped early. *We don't have validation performance data here.*

**In summary:** The initial calculation gives a wildly unrealistic estimate. With the data provided, a reliable estimate is impossible. More information about the loss curve and the trend of training time per epoch is needed. The best course of action is to monitor the job's progress and observe how the time per epoch changes.

To estimate how long the job `101M_PS8` will run, we need to analyze the provided information:

1. **Progress of the current job:**
   - The job is at epoch `1828/5000`.
   - The ratio of completed epochs is \( \frac{1828}{5000} = 0.3656 \), or roughly \( 36.56\%\).
   - Remaining epochs are \( 5000 - 1828 = 3172 \), or \( 63.44\%\).

2. **Elapsed time for the job:**
   - The job has been running for `21:22:48`, or 21.38 hours (21 hours + 22/60 + 48/3600).

3. **Time per epoch:**
   - The elapsed time corresponds to 1828 epochs.
   - Average time per epoch is \( \frac{21.38}{1828} \approx 0.0117 \) hours/epoch (42 seconds/epoch).

4. **Estimated time remaining:**
   - Remaining epochs: \( 3172 \).
   - Time required for the remaining epochs is \( 3172 \times 0.0117 \approx 37.1 \) hours.

5. **Total estimated runtime:**
   - Total runtime = elapsed time + remaining time = \( 21.38 + 37.1 = 58.48 \) hours.

### Conclusion
The job `101M_PS8` is estimated to run for approximately **58.5 hours** in total. Since it has already been running for 21.38 hours, it should complete in about **37 more hours** if the conditions remain consistent.

Let me help estimate the runtime for the 101M_PS8 job based on the information provided.



From the output, I can see:
- Current epoch: 1828/5000 (approximately 36.56% complete)
- Job has been running for: 21:22:48 (about 21.38 hours)

If we assume linear progress:
1. Time taken for 1828 epochs = 21.38 hours
2. Remaining epochs = 5000 - 1828 = 3172 epochs
3. Expected time for remaining epochs = (21.38 * 3172) / 1828 = 37.11 hours

Therefore, the total expected runtime would be:
Current runtime + Remaining time = 21.38 + 37.11 = approximately 58.49 hours (about 2.4 days)

However, please note some caveats:
1. This assumes linear training progress, which may not be accurate
2. The learning rate is being adjusted during training, which could affect speed
3. The job could potentially stop early if it reaches convergence or other stopping criteria

Based on the current statistics showing the best test accuracy hasn't improved (stuck at 52.59%), there might be early stopping implemented, which could reduce the actual runtime.

Based on the information provided:

    Job ID 950888 (which corresponds to 101M_PS8) has been running for 21 hours and 22 minutes as of the last update.


To estimate how much longer this job might run:

    We don't have direct information on the total expected runtime for this specific job from the logs. However, we can gather some contextual clues:
        The job is running on a preemptable GPU node (preemptgp), which might affect its stability or priority compared to non-preemptable jobs.
        It's on the same node type but a different node (gpu03) compared to some other jobs by the same user, which might imply similar resource constraints or performance characteristics.
    From the squeue output:
        Job 3.2B1024 has run for 21 hours 35 minutes, and 34M16HCF has been running for nearly 2 days (1 day, 17 hours, 46 minutes). This suggests that jobs on these nodes can run for extended periods, likely more than a day.
    The progress of the job from the training log:
        The job has completed 1828 epochs out of a total of 5000 epochs. This indicates it's about 36.56% through its planned iterations.


Given this information:

    Estimation: If we assume that the job's performance remains consistent (which is a big assumption given it's on a preemptable queue where it could be interrupted or slowed down):

        If the job has taken roughly 21 hours to complete 36.56% of its epochs, we can estimate the time for the remaining 63.44%:
        Time per epoch = 21.37 hours / 1828 epochs ≈ 0.0117 hours per epoch (or roughly 42 seconds per epoch)
        Remaining epochs = 5000 - 1828 = 3172 epochs
        Estimated time remaining = 3172 epochs * 0.0117 hours ≈ 37.13 hours or about 1.55 days.


However, this is a very rough estimate:

    Considerations:
        Preemptable nature might mean it could be paused or restarted, thus extending actual runtime unpredictably.
        The actual time per epoch might change due to various factors like data variability, system load, or learning rate adjustments.
        If the job has to restart or if there's a significant change in system resources, this could extend the runtime.


Therefore, while a rough estimate might suggest another 1.5 to 2 days, this should be taken with caution due to the preemptable status and the dynamic nature of such computational tasks.

## Model A: llama-3.1-tulu-3-8b

To estimate how long job `101M_PS8` (job ID 950888) will run for, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current State**: The job is currently in the `R` state, which stands for "running". If the job were in a "queued" state (e.g., `PD` for "pending"), it would not be running and the estimate would differ.

2. **Time Stamp in Output**: The tail command output indicates that the timestamp for when the command was run was `21:22:48`. However, this alone does not give us the start time of the job.

3. **Job Walltime vs. Run Time**: The job's requested walltime (total time allowed for the job to run) is not directly visible from the provided data. The walltime is the maximum duration the scheduler will allow the job to run. Without knowing the walltime, we can only estimate the remaining time based on the already elapsed time.

4. **Elapsed Time**: From the tail command output, we see that the logs are from early in the job's execution (within the first hour given the timestamp `21:22:48`). Since the learning rate adjustments and the test accuracy are still changing, it seems the job is still in the middle of its training phase.

5. **Progress and Learning Rate Adjustments**: The fact that the learning rate is being adjusted multiple times suggests the model is still training. Typically, these adjustments are done based on performance metrics and happen more frequently in the early stages of training.

6. **Historical Data and Patterns**: If similar jobs have run before and their durations are known, this data could be used to estimate the duration of `101M_PS8`. For example, if similar jobs with similar configurations ran for 48 hours on average, and 1 hour has passed, you might estimate additional runtime based on progress.

**Estimation Approach**:

- **Assuming Similar Jobs**: If historical data shows similar jobs run for approximately 48 hours in total, and we've seen about 1 hour of output so far, we could estimate about 47 hours remaining.

- **Progress-based Estimation**: If, based on the observed progress (e.g., test accuracy, learning rate adjustments), the job typically takes 48 hours to reach a stable state, and we're early in the process, we might estimate around 45-47 hours remaining.

- **Simple Elapsed Time**: If we consider only the elapsed time so far (1 hour) and assume a linear progression (which is highly unlikely but serves as a basic estimate), we'd estimate about 49 hours total (1 hour + 48 hours).

**Considering these points**, and without specific knowledge of the walltime or exact historical runtimes, a reasonable **estimate** for how long job `101M_PS8` will run might be **around 45 to 48 hours**, based on typical behavior for such training jobs given the early stage of execution and the pattern of similar jobs.

Remember, this is an estimation and actual runtimes may vary widely depending on numerous factors including system load, job priorities, hardware-specific performance, and the actual walltime requested and allocated by the scheduler. Always rely on job tracking tools and the scheduler's output for definitive information.

## Model B: o1-2024-12-17

A rough way to estimate is to look at how many epochs have completed, how many are left, and how long it has taken so far. From your logs, the job is around epoch 1828 out of 5000 (roughly 36% done), and has been running for about 21 hours.

If training speed remains roughly constant and it does indeed go all the way to epoch 5000 (no early stopping or interruptions), then you can do a proportional estimate:

1. Calculate total time if it continued at the same pace:

   \[
   \text{Time so far} \div \text{Fraction of epochs completed} 
   \;=\; 21\,\text{hours} \;/\; 0.3656 
   \;\approx\; 58.5\,\text{hours (total)}
   \]

2. Then subtract the time already elapsed to get time remaining:

   \[
   58.5\,\text{hours (total)} - 21\,\text{hours (elapsed)} 
   \;\approx\; 37.5\,\text{hours (remaining)}
   \]

Hence, if nothing else changes, you might expect it to need another day and a half (about 1.5 days) beyond the 21 hours it has already run. Of course, this is only a ballpark estimate—changes in learning rate, potential slowdowns, early stopping, or re-queueing could alter the actual runtime.
