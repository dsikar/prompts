## Create falling letters + physics with javascript

Prompt from (x.com)[ihttps://x.com/hxiao/status/1885522459329520089]

```
Create a JavaScript animation of falling letters with realistic physics. The letters should: 
* Appear randomly at the top of the screen with varying sizes 
* Fall under Earth's gravity (9.8 m/sÂ²) 
* Have collision detection based on their actual letter shapes 
* Interact with other letters, ground, and screen boundaries 
* Have density properties similar to water 
* Dynamically adapt to screen size changes 
* Display on a dark background
```
